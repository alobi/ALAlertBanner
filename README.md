# ALAlertBanner

## About

ALAlertBanner is a drop-in component for iOS (both iPhone and iPad) that allows you to display beautiful alert banners in a customizable and configurable way. 

### Improvements

![ImprovementPreview](https://raw.github.com/DJBen/ALAlertBanner/master/Screenshot/iOS%20Simulator%20Screen%20shot%20Aug%2029,%202013%2010.14.46%20AM.png)

This version of ALAlertBanner has a more consistent style with iOS 7 UI. Removed gloss, gradient and shadow... and every element that makes this banner not "flat".

The appearance in iOS 6.x and below is unchanged.

### Behind the Scenes

ALAlertBanner uses [Core Animation](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CoreAnimation_guide/Introduction/Introduction.html) and [Grand Central Dispatch](http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Performance/Reference/GCD_libdispatch_Ref/Reference/reference.html) under the hood, making it lightweight and stable. A singleton object is used to manage the presentation and dismissal of the alerts in a synchronous manner. 

## Installation

Installation is easy.

### Cocoapods

1. Add ```pod 'ALAlertBanner', '~>0.2.0'``` to your Podfile
2. ```#import <ALAlertBanner/ALAlertBanner.h>``` in your view of choice

### Manually

1. Download the ZIP from Github and copy the ALAlertBanner directory to your project
2. Link the ```QuartzCore.framework``` library in your project's Build Phases
3. ```#import "ALAlertBanner.h"``` in your view of choice

If you can compile without errors, congratulations! You're one step closer to...

### Tested Environments

ALAlertBanner has been tested to work on iOS 5.0, 5.1 and 6.0 (simulator), iOS 6.1 (device), and iOS 7.0 (simulator) with ARC enabled. 

## Example Usage

You should use the ```ALAlertBannerManager``` singleton object to manage all banners. You can easily present a banner in a regular ```UIView``` like so:

```objc
[[ALAlertBannerManager sharedManager] showAlertBannerInView:self.view 
                                                      style:ALAlertBannerStyleSuccess 
                                                   position:ALAlertBannerPositionTop 
                                                      title:@"Success!"
                                                   subtitle:@"Here's a banner. Look how easy that was."];
```

or in a ```UIWindow```:

```objc
AppDelegate *appDelegate = (AppDelegate*)[[UIApplication sharedApplication] delegate];
[[ALAlertBannerManager sharedManager] showAlertBannerInView:appDelegate.window 
                                                      style:ALAlertBannerStyleNotify 
                                                   position:ALAlertBannerPositionUnderNavBar 
                                                      title:@"Notify!"
                                                   subtitle:@"Here's another banner, and it is nice and comfy in its UIWindow"];
```

A couple notes: ```title``` is limited to one line and will be truncated if necessary. ```subtitle``` can be any number of lines. ```title``` and ```subtitle``` may be nil, but ```style``` and ```position``` should not be nil. 

### Other methods of consideration:

```objc
-(void)showAlertBannerInView:(UIView*)view 
                       style:(ALAlertBannerStyle)style 
                    position:(ALAlertBannerPosition)position 
                       title:(NSString*)title 
                    subtitle:(NSString*)subtitle 
                   hideAfter:(NSTimeInterval)secondsToShow;
```

Optional method to set the secondsToShow duration on a per-banner basis.

```objc
-(void)showAlertBannerInView:(UIView*)view 
                       style:(ALAlertBannerStyle)style 
                    position:(ALAlertBannerPosition)position 
                       title:(NSString*)title 
                    subtitle:(NSString*)subtitle 
               tappedHandler:(void(^)(ALAlertBannerView *alertBanner))tappedBlock; 

-(void)showAlertBannerInView:(UIView*)view 
                       style:(ALAlertBannerStyle)style 
                    position:(ALAlertBannerPosition)position 
                       title:(NSString*)title 
                    subtitle:(NSString*)subtitle 
                   hideAfter:(NSTimeInterval)secondsToShow 
               tappedHandler:(void(^)(ALAlertBannerView *alertBanner))tappedBlock; 
```

Optional methods to handle a tap on a banner. 
 
By default, supplying a tap handler will disable ```allowTapToDismiss``` on this particular banner. If you want to reinstate this behavior alongside the tap handler, you can call ```[[ALAlertBannerManager sharedManager] hideAlertBanner:alertBanner];``` in ```tappedBlock()```.

```objc
-(void)hideAlertBanner:(ALAlertBannerView *)alertBanner;
```

Immediately hide a specific alert banner.

```objc
-(NSArray *)alertBannersInView:(UIView*)view;
```

Returns an array of all banners within a certain view.

```objc
-(void)hideAllAlertBanners;
```

Immediately hides all alert banners in all views.

```objc
-(void)hideAlertBannersInView:(UIView*)view;
```

Immediately hides all alert banners in a certain view.

### Global Properties

***Note:*** ALL properties should be set through ```ALAlertBannerManager``` like so:

```objc
[[ALAlertBannerManager sharedManager] setProperty:0.f];
```

Some properties can be set on a per-banner basis by using the appropriate methods in [Example Usage](#example-usage).

***End Note***

---

```ALAlertBannerManager``` has the following editable properties:

```objc
/**
 Length of time in seconds that a banner should show before auto-hiding. 
 
 Default value is 3.5 seconds. A value <= 0 will disable auto-hiding.
 */
@property (nonatomic) NSTimeInterval secondsToShow;

/**
 The length of time it takes a banner to transition on-screen. 
 
 Default value is 0.25 seconds.
 */
@property (nonatomic) NSTimeInterval showAnimationDuration;

/**
 The length of time it takes a banner to transition off-screen. 
 
 Default value is 0.2 seconds.
 */
@property (nonatomic) NSTimeInterval hideAnimationDuration;

/**
 Banner opacity, between 0 and 1. 
 
 Default value is 0.93f.
 */
@property (nonatomic, assign) CGFloat bannerOpacity;

/**
 Tapping on a banner will dismiss it early. 
 
 Default value is YES. If you supply a tappedHandler in one of the appropriate methods, this will be set to NO for that specific banner.
 */
@property (nonatomic, assign) BOOL allowTapToDismiss;
```


### Banner Positions

```objc
ALAlertBannerPositionTop = 0
```

The banner will be extend down from the top of the screen. If you're presenting it in a:

* ```UIView```: the banner will extend down from underneath the status bar (if visible)

* ```UIView``` within a ```UINavigationController```: it will extend down from underneath the navigation bar

* ```UIWindow```: it should extend down from underneath the status bar but above any other UI elements, like the nav bar for instance 

```objc
ALAlertBannerPositionBottom
```

The banner will be extend up from the bottom of the screen. 

```objc
ALAlertBannerPositionUnderNavBar
```

This position should **ONLY** be used if presenting in a ```UIWindow```. It will create an effect similar to ```ALAlertBannerPositionTop``` on a ```UIView``` within a ```UINavigationController``` (i.e. extending down from underneath the navigation bar), but it will in fact be above all other views. It accomplishes this by using a ```CALayer``` mask. This position is useful if you want to do something like set up a "catch-all" error handler in your AppDelegate that responds to notifications about a certain event (like network requests, for instance), yet you still want it to animate from underneath the nav bar. 

### Banner Types

```objc
ALAlertBannerStyleSuccess = 0
```

The banner will have a cute little checkmark and a nice green gradient.

```objc
ALAlertBannerStyleFailure
```

The banner will have a cute little X and a nice red gradient.

```objc
ALAlertBannerStyleNotify
```

The banner will have a cute little info symbol and a nice blue gradient.

```objc
ALAlertBannerStyleAlert
```

The banner will have a cute little caution triangle and a nice yellow gradient.

Did I mention they have cute little shapes and nice colorful gradients?

## Known Issues

* **FIXED** ~~ALAlertBanner supports all interface orientations. However, if you rotate the device while one or more banners is displaying (or animating), the layout will get fudgesicled. This is just something I haven't figured out how to fix yet.~~
* Alert banners won't rotate when added to a UIWindow. This is something I haven't added yet but will try to get to soon.
* On the topic of rotation, ALAlertBanner listens for ```UIDeviceOrientationDidChangeNotification```  to handle rotation events. I'd prefer to listen for ```UIApplicationDidChangeStatusBarOrientationNotification``` instead but I need the bounds of the banner's superview to update before handling the rotation notification, and the only way to that seems to be by using ```UIDeviceOrientationDidChangeNotification```. If you have an idea on how to fix this, please let me know by submitting a new issue or sending me an email.
* If you find any other bugs, please open a new issue.
